# DataAnalysis




* [Visualizing Earnings Based On College Majors](https://github.com/spajeo/DataAnalysis_MachineLearning/tree/master/Visualizing%20Earnings%20Based%20On%20College%20Majors)  
I'll be working with a dataset on the job outcomes of students who graduated from college between 2010 and 2012. Using visualizations, we can start to explore questions

* [Analyzing Gender Gap In College Degrees](https://github.com/spajeo/DataAnalysis_MachineLearning/tree/master/Analyzing%20Gender%20Gap%20In%20College%20Degrees)  
I'll extend the work on [visualizing the gender gap across college degrees](https://github.com/spajeo/DataAnalysis_MachineLearning/tree/master/Visualizing%20Earnings%20Based%20On%20College%20Majors). So far, we mostly focused on the STEM degrees but now we will generate line charts to compare across all degree categories.


* [Analyzing Movie Reviews](https://github.com/spajeo/DataAnalysis_MachineLearning/tree/master/Analyzing%20Movie%20Reviews)   
Is there a bias amoungs the movie review sites ([**RottenTomatoes**](https://rottentomatoes.com/), [**Metacritic**](http://www.metacritic.com/), [**IMDB**](https://www.imdb.com/), and [**Fandango**](https://www.fandango.com/))?

* [Analyzing Star Wars Survey](https://github.com/spajeo/DataAnalysis_MachineLearning/tree/master/Analyzing%20Star%20Wars%20Survey)   
[FiveThirtyEight](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/star-wars-survey) managed to survey  835 people in order to reply to the question : **does the rest of America realize that “The Empire Strikes Back” is clearly the best of the bunch?**


* [Analyzing Thanksgiving Dinner](https://github.com/spajeo/DataAnalysis_MachineLearning/tree/master/Analyzing%20Thanksgiving%20Dinner)   
In this project, I'll explore the data, and try to find interesting patterns.


* [Analyzing Winning Jeopardy](https://github.com/spajeo/DataAnalysis_MachineLearning/tree/master/Analyzing%20Winning%20Jeopardy)   
Let's say you want to compete on Jeopardy, and you're looking for any edge you can get to win. In this project, I'll work with a dataset of Jeopardy questions to figure out some patterns in the questions that could help win.

* [Exploring Gun Deaths in the US](https://github.com/spajeo/DataAnalysis_MachineLearning/blob/master/Exploring%20Gun%20Deaths%20in%20the%20US/README.md)   
In this project, I'll explore the data, and try to find interesting patterns.

* [Predicting Bike Rentals](https://github.com/spajeo/DataAnalysis_MachineLearning/tree/master/Predicting%20Bike%20Rentals)   
Washington, D.C. is one of the cities having communal bike sharing stations where you can rent bicycles by the hour or day. The District collects detailed data on the number of bicycles people rent by the hour and day. I am going predict user beahavior depending on other parameters.
* [Predicting Lending Club Loans](https://github.com/spajeo/DataAnalysis_MachineLearning/tree/master/Predicting%20Lending%20Club%20Loans)   
I am using a machine learning model to predict whether or not we should fund a loan on the Lending Club platform.

* [Predicting house sales prices](https://github.com/spajeo/DataAnalysis_MachineLearning/tree/master/Predicting%20house%20sales%20prices)  

* [Predicting the stock market](https://github.com/spajeo/DataAnalysis_MachineLearning/tree/master/Predicting%20the%20stock%20market)
