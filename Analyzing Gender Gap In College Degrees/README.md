# Objective 

I'll extend the work on [visualizing the gender gap across college degrees](https://github.com/spajeo/DataAnalysis_MachineLearning/tree/master/Visualizing%20Earnings%20Based%20On%20College%20Majors). So far, we mostly focused on the STEM degrees but now we will generate line charts to compare across all degree categories.
