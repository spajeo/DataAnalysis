While waiting for [Star Wars: The Force Awakens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_The_Force_Awakens) to come out, the team at [FiveThirty]Eight(https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/star-wars-survey) became interested in answering some questions about Star Wars fans. 
In particular, they wondered: **does the rest of America realize that “The Empire Strikes Back” is clearly the best of the bunch?**

The team needed to collect data addressing this question. To do this, they surveyed Star Wars fans using the online tool SurveyMonkey. They received 835 total responses, which you download from their [GitHub repository](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/star-wars-survey).



Here are some potential next steps:

Try to segment the data based on columns like Education, Location (Census Region), and Which character shot first?, which aren't binary. Are they any interesting patterns?
Clean up columns 15 to 29, which contain data on the characters respondents view favorably and unfavorably.
Which character do respondents like the most?
Which character do respondents dislike the most?
Which character is the most controversial (split between likes and dislikes)?
