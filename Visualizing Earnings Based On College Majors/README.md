Here are some potential next steps:

Try to segment the data based on columns like Education, Location (Census Region), and Which character shot first?, which aren't binary. Are they any interesting patterns?
Clean up columns 15 to 29, which contain data on the characters respondents view favorably and unfavorably.
Which character do respondents like the most?
Which character do respondents dislike the most?
Which character is the most controversial (split between likes and dislikes)?
