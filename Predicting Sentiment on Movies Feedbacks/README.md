# Objective

I want to predict whether a review is negative or positive, based on the text alone.

# Dataset 
In this mission, I'll be working with a CSV file containing movie reviews. Each row contains the text of the review, as well as a number indicating whether the tone of the review is positive(1) or negative(-1).
